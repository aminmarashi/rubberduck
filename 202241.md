[New architecture to make AI better](https://blog.seas.upenn.edu/rethinking-the-computer-chip-in-the-age-of-ai/)

The team has designed a new computer architecture called Compute-in-memory or CIM. The idea is that AI is a memory intensive task and the memory is the bottleneck.

That means no matter how fast the CPU is because processing machine learning algorithms requires a lot of memory access the speed will be bound to the memory speed.

The new architecture does not use transistors, instead it uses ferrodiodes which makes it possible to store data and process on the same chip.

This means that faster access to memory and less power consumption.

[Improving Firefox performance on macos](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/10/improving-firefox-responsiveness-on-macos/)

Firefox used spinning locks on MacOs to increase performance of concurrent threads when the load on the system was low. Putting threads to sleep is has a performance hit, because it gives OS the chance to switch the context and run another thread, clearing all the cached data in process.

On the other hand, when a spinning lock is acquired the CPU needs to be running to check if the lock is still used. This in a heavily used system can cause even more performance hit, because multiple threads may be competing for CPU cycles just to check for the lock.

Moreover these spins are done in the user space where the code doesn’t have any information about the load on the system.

Turns out MacOs offers an undocumented lock that spins in the kernel space. This allows the thread to go to sleep whenever there is a heavy load on the system and when there is not much load it will just spin in the kernel space.

[How does Wine work](https://werat.dev/blog/how-wine-works-101/)

Wine is a recursive acronym for Wine Is Not an Emulator, it is however a UNIX-like binary that is responsible for parsing the executable made for Windows and convert them into code that can run on UNIX-like OSs.

The idea is that in order to run Windows application no emulation is required because the binary code generated for the application itself is identical for Linux and Windows (mostly). Given that information Wine can read that executable file and find the code, replace the parts that are meant for Windows to things that the Linux Kernel understands.

How does Wine handle system calls? The answer is not simple, intercepting every syscall would be extremely slow and make the apps running on Wine sluggish. Fortunately most Windows applications use a standard library instead of making syscalls directly. Therefore Wine implements a version of those standard libraries that under the hood call Linux kernel syscalls. This workaround is not universal and breaks the apps that rely on syscalls directly on the Windows domain, for those to work a better solution is required.

[Flatten was renamed to flat to stay compatible](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/smooshgate/)

The proposal to add a `flatten` function to JavaScript has been there a long time and when it was released for the first time it broke a few popular websites that used MooTools.

MooTools defines its own `Array.prototype.flatten` function, and then copies over all the enumerable properties of `Array` to `Elements`. After the release, the `flatten` function becomes a native function and is not enumerable anymore, so it is not copied over to `Elements`. This breaks the websites that relied on the `Elements.prototype.flatten` function.

The author of MooTools jokingly proposed renaming `flatten` to `smoosh` as a solution. Even though this proposal got a lot of attention, it was not accepted. Instead `flat` was chosen as a replacement for `flatten` to stay compatible with MooTools.

## Software and services

[The Hummingbird Clock: Date videos by background mains hum](git@github.com:aminmarashi/rubberduck.git)

The electricity running through wires makes a consistent but subtle noise which changes by the slight changes in the frequency of the mains electricity. This is the same noise that is heard in the background of many videos. You can submit your own videos to the project and it will use the record to find the place and time of the recording. The british goverment has used this for surveillance in the past.

[Satori: convert HTML and CSS to SVG](https://github.com/vercel/satori)

This open-source tool allows you to convert HTML elements to SVG. Text will be converted to graphs but you have an option to embed fonts instead.

[Command-line and local web note taking](https://xwmx.github.io/nb/)

A nice tool which can be used to create notes from Markdown, Org and LaTeX. It can be used for creating bookmarks from URLs as well. And it supports searching through documents and tags.

[Ultra low-power underwater camera](https://news.mit.edu/2022/battery-free-wireless-underwater-camera-0926)

Researchers in MIT have developed a camera that can be powered by the ambient noise in the water. The camera is powered by a piezoelectric generator that converts the vibrations into electricity.

The camera is extremely low-powered and can only capture black and white images. The camera sends data through sound. A receiver transmits sound waves to the camera, the camera then uses a mirror to reflect the waves back to signal 1 and moves the mirror to an absorber to signal 0.

The future work will be made to add more memory to capture videos and increase the range of the camera.

[Patterns for web apps](https://web.dev/new-patterns-for-amazing-apps/)

These are patterns to interact with web applications in a similar way as native apps in a way that is supported by most browsers (mostly Chrome).

[Linux LILFS: automatic continuous snapshots](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2022-10-05-linux-nilfs-filesystem.html)

LILFS is a filesystem in Linux that works based on Copy on Write (CoW) principle, meaning that every write creates a new version of the data, instead of overwriting the old one. This allows the filesystem to keep track of all the changes made to the data and revert to any previous version.

The biggest concern is the space that is required to keep all the versions of the data. LILFS solves this by using a garbage collector that deletes the old versions of the data that are not used anymore.

[multi-platform screen and application forwarding system](https://xpra.org/)

>  On X11, it is also known as screen for X11: it allows you to run programs, usually on a remote host, direct their display to your local machine, and then to disconnect from these programs and reconnect from the same or another machine, without losing any state. 

[Face recognition invisibility cloak](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/projects/invisible/)

A group of researchers at the University of Maryland have developed a system that can make a person invisible to face recognition systems. The system uses a 3D printed mask that is placed over the face and a camera that captures the face and the mask. The mask is then used to replace the face in the video.
