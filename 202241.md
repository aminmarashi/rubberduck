[New architecture to make AI better](https://blog.seas.upenn.edu/rethinking-the-computer-chip-in-the-age-of-ai/)

The team has designed a new computer architecture called Compute-in-memory or CIM. The idea is that AI is a memory intensive task and the memory is the bottleneck.

That means no matter how fast the CPU is because processing machine learning algorithms requires a lot of memory access the speed will be bound to the memory speed.

The new architecture does not use transistors, instead it uses ferrodiodes which makes it possible to store data and process on the same chip.

This means that faster access to memory and less power consumption.

## Software and services

[The Hummingbird Clock: Date videos by background mains hum](git@github.com:aminmarashi/rubberduck.git)

The electricity running through wires makes a consistent but subtle noise which changes by the slight changes in the frequency of the mains electricity. This is the same noise that is heard in the background of many videos. You can submit your own videos to the project and it will use the record to find the place and time of the recording. The british goverment has used this for surveillance in the past.

[Ultra low-power underwater camera](https://news.mit.edu/2022/battery-free-wireless-underwater-camera-0926)

Researchers in MIT have developed a camera that can be powered by the ambient noise in the water. The camera is powered by a piezoelectric generator that converts the vibrations into electricity.

The camera is extremely low-powered and can only capture black and white images. The camera sends data through sound. A receiver transmits sound waves to the camera, the camera then uses a mirror to reflect the waves back to signal 1 and moves the mirror to an absorber to signal 0.

The future work will be made to add more memory to capture videos and increase the range of the camera.
