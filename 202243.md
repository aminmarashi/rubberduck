[When is Short Tenure a red flag](https://jacobian.org/2022/oct/14/when-is-short-tenure-a-red-flag/)

A lot of hiring managers see short tenure as a red flag. This article explains why that is not always the case.

It gives a few examples of when the short tenure is not sign of a problem, including when the person was a contractor, they were layed off multiple times, changing jobs at the beginning of the career, they were underpaid and had to job hop to get their salary up.

But there could also be a few bad reasons for short tenure, including being repeatedly fired because of bad behavior, or repeatedly left their job because of interpersonal conflicts, or a history of underperforming.

The idea is that short tenure shouldn't be a reason to stay in a job longer or to dismiss a candidate, but could be a reason to ask more questions.

[Use XDG variables to know where your files are](https://0x46.net/thoughts/2019/02/01/dotfile-madness/)

Creating dotfiles in the users' home directory is becoming a common practice but has a negative effect on the user experience. For one thing the home directory is supposed to host the files that belong to the user and the user should have control over what's stored there.

Instead of putting the dotfiles in the home directory, developers are encouraged to use the XDG variables to store the files in the appropriate directories on Linux and their equivalents on other operating systems (look for the cross platform implementation of this in your favorite programming language).

[Sharing zip files as JPG on Twitter](https://twitter.com/david3141593/status/1057042085029822464)

The author has successfully injected a zip file into a JPG file and shared it on Twitter. The best part is that the Twitter thumbnailer doesn't seem to affect this, and now the image can be downloaded and extracted as a zip file from Twitter itself. It works because the magic number of a JPG file is stored at the beginning of the file and the zip file magic number is stored at the end of the file.

# Software and services

[Docker + WASM](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-wasm-technical-preview/)

For the past few weeks, there has been many articles about how WASM could be a replacement for containers. Now Docker has decided to chip in and collaborate with the WASM team to create containerized WASM runtimes. This provides additional features for Docker containers, including better isolation and ability to run it on a variety of platforms.

If you are already using WASM this is unlikely to help you in any way, maybe only useful if you want to orchestrate Docker containers and WASM runtimes together.

Otherwise a lot of people see it as an attempt from Docker to survive the rise of WASM. A few people have mentioned [this talk](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript) about the future of JavaScript and containers.
