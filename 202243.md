[When is Short Tenure a red flag](https://jacobian.org/2022/oct/14/when-is-short-tenure-a-red-flag/)

A lot of hiring managers see short tenure as a red flag. This article explains why that is not always the case.

It gives a few examples of when the short tenure is not sign of a problem, including when the person was a contractor, they were layed off multiple times, changing jobs at the beginning of the career, they were underpaid and had to job hop to get their salary up.

But there could also be a few bad reasons for short tenure, including being repeatedly fired because of bad behavior, or repeatedly left their job because of interpersonal conflicts, or a history of underperforming.

The idea is that short tenure shouldn't be a reason to stay in a job longer or to dismiss a candidate, but could be a reason to ask more questions.

[Use XDG variables to know where your files are](https://0x46.net/thoughts/2019/02/01/dotfile-madness/)

Creating dotfiles in the users' home directory is becoming a common practice but has a negative effect on the user experience. For one thing the home directory is supposed to host the files that belong to the user and the user should have control over what's stored there.

Instead of putting the dotfiles in the home directory, developers are encouraged to use the XDG variables to store the files in the appropriate directories on Linux and their equivalents on other operating systems (look for the cross platform implementation of this in your favorite programming language).

[Sharing zip files as JPG on Twitter](https://twitter.com/david3141593/status/1057042085029822464)

The author has successfully injected a zip file into a JPG file and shared it on Twitter. The best part is that the Twitter thumbnailer doesn't seem to affect this, and now the image can be downloaded and extracted as a zip file from Twitter itself. It works because the magic number of a JPG file is stored at the beginning of the file and the zip file magic number is stored at the end of the file.

[How I recorded user behaviour on my competitorâ€™s websites](https://dejanmarketing.com/competitor-hack/)

The author replaced the google's result page in the history with his own spoofed version of the results that included links to the mirrors of its competitors and used it for analysis of the user behavior on the competitor's websites.

[Meta is migrating to Kotlin](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/24/android/android-java-kotlin-migration/)

Meta is migrating its 10M loc codebase from Java to Kotlin. They decided to convert almost all of the codebase to Kotlin. They are using J2K to convert the codebase, but the tool is not perfect and they had to fix many issues manually. To fix those issues they have created automated refactoring scripts that runs after J2K. If the code compiles and passes the CI, it gets commited.

[Docker + WASM](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-wasm-technical-preview/)

For the past few weeks, there has been many articles about how WASM could be a replacement for containers. Now Docker has decided to chip in and collaborate with the WASM team to create containerized WASM runtimes. This provides additional features for Docker containers, including better isolation and ability to run it on a variety of platforms.

If you are already using WASM this is unlikely to help you in any way, maybe only useful if you want to orchestrate Docker containers and WASM runtimes together.

Otherwise a lot of people see it as an attempt from Docker to survive the rise of WASM. A few people have mentioned [this talk](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript) about the future of JavaScript and containers.

[asdf is a version manager for multiple languages](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/introduction.html)

It is similar to pyenv, nvm, rbenv, etc. but supports a lot more tools. It is useful if you want to have multiple versions of the same tools on your system and switch between them easily.

It works by installing plugins for each tool, when a plugin is installed a shim is created in the PATH that will look for the specific version of the tool from the .tool-versions file in the current directory, or its parents up until the home directory.

This way you can define different versions of each tool based on the project you are working on.
