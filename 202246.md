[Rust and C++ interoperability](https://slint-ui.com/blog/rust-and-cpp.html)

The idea is that users of both languages can benefit from interoperability. The problem is that it is not so easy to do, because Rust does not have a stable ABI and especially data types you have in either side are not compatible. The proposed solution is to create a set of functions and data types that can be a foundation for this interoperability.
It works by defining the ABI for both sides, and it will generate the required C++ code to make sure of the data types compatibility.

# Stories

[Story about how Intel won the PC race](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-inside-story-of-texas-instruments-biggest-blunder-the-tms9900-microprocessor)

The idea is that Intel was the first to ship production-ready chips to the market, and IBM needed to enter the race of personal computers with a chip. Even though the 8080 was not the best alternative, and it even had a different endian-ness than IBM computers, it won the race because it was the first to ship.

[The leap second will be discontinued after 2035](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03783-5)

The earth rotation is not completely constant, it can get slower or faster depending on many natural factors. This would allow the time measured by atomic clocks (UTC) to diverge from the time it takes the earth to rotate around the sun (UT1). This historically has been mostly an additional second added to the UTC time, but in 2020 the rotation sped up which resulted in a second being removed. Mostly big tech companies called for this change (including Google, Meta, etc.) to get around that additional complexity.

After 2035 the leap second will not be added up to one minute (the actual limit is not set in stone yet), meaning that the UTC time may diverge quite significantly from UT1.

# Software

[Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/blog/introducing-tailscale-funnel/)

It allows you to publish your local nodes in a Tailscale VPN (which is a tool to connect local devices securely) to the internet behind SSL. It is still in Alpha version but it is worth keeping an eye on, for when you want to securely publish your local webserver over the net.
