[Rust and C++ interoperability](https://slint-ui.com/blog/rust-and-cpp.html)

The idea is that users of both languages can benefit from interoperability. The problem is that it is not so easy to do, because Rust does not have a stable ABI and especially data types you have in either side are not compatible. The proposed solution is to create a set of functions and data types that can be a foundation for this interoperability.
It works by defining the ABI for both sides, and it will generate the required C++ code to make sure of the data types compatibility.
