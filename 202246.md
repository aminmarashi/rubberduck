[Rust and C++ interoperability](https://slint-ui.com/blog/rust-and-cpp.html)

The idea is that users of both languages can benefit from interoperability. The problem is that it is not so easy to do, because Rust does not have a stable ABI and especially data types you have in either side are not compatible. The proposed solution is to create a set of functions and data types that can be a foundation for this interoperability.
It works by defining the ABI for both sides, and it will generate the required C++ code to make sure of the data types compatibility.

[DOS protected mode](https://pikuma.com/blog/what-is-dos4gw-protected-mode)

This article gives a background about the DOS protected mode, why it was made and how the applications used to run on DOS before it existed. It is a good historical background about how DOS evolved as an operating system according to the hardware and user needs.

# Stories

[Story about how Intel won the PC race](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-inside-story-of-texas-instruments-biggest-blunder-the-tms9900-microprocessor)

The idea is that Intel was the first to ship production-ready chips to the market, and IBM needed to enter the race of personal computers with a chip. Even though the 8080 was not the best alternative, and it even had a different endian-ness than IBM computers, it won the race because it was the first to ship.

[The leap second will be discontinued after 2035](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03783-5)

The earth rotation is not completely constant, it can get slower or faster depending on many natural factors. This would allow the time measured by atomic clocks (UTC) to diverge from the time it takes the earth to rotate around the sun (UT1). This historically has been mostly an additional second added to the UTC time, but in 2020 the rotation sped up which resulted in a second being removed. Mostly big tech companies called for this change (including Google, Meta, etc.) to get around that additional complexity.

After 2035 the leap second will not be added up to one minute (the actual limit is not set in stone yet), meaning that the UTC time may diverge quite significantly from UT1.

[How steam font was changed after 2038](http://blog.pkh.me/p/35-investigating-why-steam-started-picking-a-random-font.html)

The author has changed the date and time of their computer in order to unlock an achievement in a game and unintentionally triggered a year 2038 bug. It's an interesting read about how it happened and how it was fixed.

[Kite has failed, but open sourced its code before dying](https://www.kite.com/blog/product/kite-is-saying-farewell/)

The article talks about how they didn't manage to make a business out of it, mainly because developers don't want to pay for their tools. That's actually not a valid point, as developers have proven to pay for a product that generates value for them, examples are: Webstorm, Github Copilot, MonoLisa, and many more, but kudos to them for open sourcing their code.

# Software

[Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/blog/introducing-tailscale-funnel/)

It allows you to publish your local nodes in a Tailscale VPN (which is a tool to connect local devices securely) to the internet behind SSL. It is still in Alpha version but it is worth keeping an eye on, for when you want to securely publish your local webserver over the net.

[devenv a user-friendly interface for Nix](https://devenv.sh/)

[Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/)

It is a project to create one web page for every book ever published. It is a non-profit project and it is open source. It is a great resource for finding books, reading them and it is also a great way to contribute to the project.

[ES for Eclipse Vert.x](https://reactiverse.io/es4x/get-started/#how-it-works)

Run reactive JavaScript code on the JVM. Works like any other JavaScript project. GraalVM is used to compile the code to native code.

[Quirks of C](https://gist.github.com/fay59/5ccbe684e6e56a7df8815c3486568f01)

I love C but some of those really made me cringe.
