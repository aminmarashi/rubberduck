[Rust and C++ interoperability](https://slint-ui.com/blog/rust-and-cpp.html)

The idea is that users of both languages can benefit from interoperability. The problem is that it is not so easy to do, because Rust does not have a stable ABI and especially data types you have in either side are not compatible. The proposed solution is to create a set of functions and data types that can be a foundation for this interoperability.
It works by defining the ABI for both sides, and it will generate the required C++ code to make sure of the data types compatibility.

[Story about how Intel won the PC race](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-inside-story-of-texas-instruments-biggest-blunder-the-tms9900-microprocessor)

The idea is that Intel was the first to ship production-ready chips to the market, and IBM needed to enter the race of personal computers with a chip. Even though the 8080 was not the best alternative, and it even had a different endian-ness than IBM computers, it won the race because it was the first to ship.
