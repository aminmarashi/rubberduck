[Programmers should chase Mode rather than Niche](https://scottjack.me/niches-are-overrated/)

A lot of people give advice to developers to pick a niche and double down rather than being jack of all trades. But in reality this advice is unfounded. Instead of picking a niche a better strategy is to pick a Mode, which you are comfortable with and would like to be in no matter what happens for longer period of time.

You will inevitably find your niche by being yourself, and shaping your work around your character if you stay with it long enough (and probably that's where the misconception of finding your niche comes from).
