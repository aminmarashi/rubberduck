[RCE on tailscale nodes](https://emily.id.au/tailscale)

The idea is the hacker can gain access to the nodes inside your tailscale network by performing a DNS rebinding attack. Once the access to a node is gained the attacker then can use the node to gain access to other nodes in the network or to do remote code execution on the node itself. This attack is possible on Windows machines and there is already a fix released for it.

[Betting on things that never change](https://collabfund.com/blog/betting-on-things-that-never-change/)

There are two mindsets about startups: 1. betting on something changing in the future, and 2. betting on something that will not change in the future. The later is going to be easier to make sure of because of for example how the human nature works.

[Implementing a BFT JSON CRDT](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/bft-json-crdt/)

CRDT algorithms help to solve the problem of eventual consistency in distributed systems, where individual nodes can make changes to the same data without knowing about changes being made by the rest of the system. The author implements a Byzantine Fault Tolerant JSON CRDT from scratch.

[Making a high documentation low meeting culture](https://www.tremendous.com/blog/the-perks-of-a-high-documentation-low-meeting-work-culture)

Tremendous managed to make a low meeting culture and therefore making more time for things like documentation, as a result they had better documentation that helped them reduce the number of meetings to make things more clear as well. This also promotes autonomy which in turn increases productivity. It also provides more focus time for employees and that increases the effectiveness.

[Why Cloudflare decided to move away from one IP per server and how](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-servers-dont-own-ips-anymore/)

The original Cloudflare setup was so that the ingress traffic used BGP anycast routing and the egress used unicast routing. Each server in the datacenters had its own unique source IP address and the ingress routing was done in a way that traffic would be directed to the right datacenter that contians the destination server. However after the number of services CF provides grew significantly, this was no longer feasible.

Instead they are now assigning each datacenter an IP address, and servers have their own range of source ports. They use a load balancer, to identify and route the incoming traffic to the right datacenter and the right server.

[How BSPs were used to increase the rendering performance of early 3D games](https://twobithistory.org/2019/11/06/doom-bsp.html)

The idea is that when you want to render a scene you want to know how each object is positioned relative to the rest of objects and the camera, most importantly which object is in the front and which one is in the back. Determining so was computationally expensive so games had to improvise and use heuristic algorithms to achive an approximation of the correct order, that's why in many games the objects kept flickering. The makers of Wolfenstein 3D and Doom used a different approach, they used a binary space partitioning algorithm to determine the order of the objects, and that's how they were able to achieve a much better performance and a much more accurate order of the objects.

[An interactive guide to flexbox](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/)

This is one of the best interactive guides to flexbox I've seen so far, if you want to know how flexbox works this is a great place to start. It goes beyond an introductory level, and gives you a depper understanding of flexbox logic (and CSS in general).

[Hurl: define logic for sending HTTP requests](https://hurl.dev/)

It helps you write simple scripts that to send HTTP requests can be used for testing APIs.
