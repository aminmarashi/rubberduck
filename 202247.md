[RCE on tailscale nodes](https://emily.id.au/tailscale)

The idea is the hacker can gain access to the nodes inside your tailscale network by performing a DNS rebinding attack. Once the access to a node is gained the attacker then can use the node to gain access to other nodes in the network or to do remote code execution on the node itself. This attack is possible on Windows machines and there is already a fix released for it.

[Betting on things that never change](https://collabfund.com/blog/betting-on-things-that-never-change/)

There are two mindsets about startups: 1. betting on something changing in the future, and 2. betting on something that will not change in the future. The later is going to be easier to make sure of because of for example how the human nature works.

[Implementing a BFT JSON CRDT](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/bft-json-crdt/)

CRDT algorithms help to solve the problem of eventual consistency in distributed systems, where individual nodes can make changes to the same data without knowing about changes being made by the rest of the system. The author implements a Byzantine Fault Tolerant JSON CRDT from scratch.

[How BSPs were used to increase the rendering performance of early 3D games](https://twobithistory.org/2019/11/06/doom-bsp.html)

The idea is that when you want to render a scene you want to know how each object is positioned relative to the rest of objects and the camera, most importantly which object is in the front and which one is in the back. Determining so was computationally expensive so games had to improvise and use heuristic algorithms to achive an approximation of the correct order, that's why in many games the objects kept flickering. The makers of Wolfenstein 3D and Doom used a different approach, they used a binary space partitioning algorithm to determine the order of the objects, and that's how they were able to achieve a much better performance and a much more accurate order of the objects.

[Why does the E12 resistor use 27 and 33](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/643070/why-does-the-e12-resistor-sequence-use-27-and-33-instead-of-26-and-32)

A story about how WW2 affected the resistor values used in the E12 resistor sequence.
