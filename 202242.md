[A potential lawsuit against Github Copilot](https://githubcopilotinvestigation.com/)

The idea is that Github Copilot seems to be producing FOSS code without attribution. The worst part is that there is no way for authors to prevent their open-source code from being used and produced (sometimes exactly) by copilot, when they host their FOSS code on Github regardless of the license.

Even not hosting the code on Github doesn't prevent someone else to copy the code on Github (license allowing) and make it available to Copliot without the author's consent.

Given the usefulness of Github copilot for many developers forcing Microsoft to stop the service would be a sad thing to see, but I hope that a middle-ground will be found to keep the service alive while respecting the wish of code authors.

[Product vs Engineering bottleneck](https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/03-product-v-engineering.html)

Management is easier with functional organizational structures. Scaleups are built around groups with common skill sets and a functional line manager responsible for developing those skills and promoting careers.

When team members identify with their functional group, tribalism and friction can build in. Both teams should report to the same manager or executive to remove interteam obstacles.

In many firms, Product and Engineering is the last barrier to fall. Creating intrinsically motivated teams that generate business and customer value requires a cohesive Product Team.

[Error handling is a team sport](https://wix-ux.com/when-life-gives-you-lemons-write-better-error-messages-46c5223e1a2f)

The idea is that error messages are often neglected because Product Managers, and designers consider the happy path and leave creating good error messages to the users. However when error happens that's when the user needs the most help. The article explains how they managed to form a cross-functional team to improve error messages.

[Fine grained personal access tokens for Github](https://github.blog/2022-10-18-introducing-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens-for-github/)

Data breaches are caused by stolen and compromised credentials.

Fine-grained personal access tokens have access to GitHub's organization, user, and repository APIs.

Fine-grained PATs expire and can't access all repositories.

GitHub encourages fine-grained PATs whenever possible.
