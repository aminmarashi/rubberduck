[A potential lawsuit against Github Copilot](https://githubcopilotinvestigation.com/)

The idea is that Github Copilot seems to be producing FOSS code without attribution. The worst part is that there is no way for authors to prevent their open-source code from being used and produced (sometimes exactly) by copilot, when they host their FOSS code on Github regardless of the license.

Even not hosting the code on Github doesn't prevent someone else to copy the code on Github (license allowing) and make it available to Copliot without the author's consent.

Given the usefulness of Github copilot for many developers forcing Microsoft to stop the service would be a sad thing to see, but I hope that a middle-ground will be found to keep the service alive while respecting the wish of code authors.
