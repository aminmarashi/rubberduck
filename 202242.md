[A potential lawsuit against Github Copilot](https://githubcopilotinvestigation.com/)

The idea is that Github Copilot seems to be producing FOSS code without attribution. The worst part is that there is no way for authors to prevent their open-source code from being used and produced (sometimes exactly) by copilot, when they host their FOSS code on Github regardless of the license.

Even not hosting the code on Github doesn't prevent someone else to copy the code on Github (license allowing) and make it available to Copliot without the author's consent.

Given the usefulness of Github copilot for many developers forcing Microsoft to stop the service would be a sad thing to see, but I hope that a middle-ground will be found to keep the service alive while respecting the wish of code authors.

[Product vs Engineering bottleneck](https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/03-product-v-engineering.html)

Functional organizational structures make it easier to manage a company. Forming groups around common skill sets and capabilities with a functional line manager responsible for developing those skills and advancing careers is the foundation of any scaleup.

But when team members begin to identify and align themselves with their functional group, tribalism can set in and friction between teams is created. It's easier to remove interteam barriers when both teams report up to the same manager or executive.

This is why the last barrier to fall in many organizations is the one between Product and Engineering. Operating as a unified Product Team is central to creating intrinsically motivated teams that thrive at delivering business and customer value.

[Fine grained personal access tokens for Github](https://github.blog/2022-10-18-introducing-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens-for-github/)

Stolen and compromised credentials are the number one cause of data breaches across the industry.
Fine-grained personal access tokens, by contrast, are given permissions from a set of over 50 granular permissions that control access to GitHub’s organization, user, and repository APIs.
Fine-grained personal access tokens also expire, and they don’t have access to all the repositories a user can access.
Choosing the right programmatic access method Whenever possible, GitHub recommends using fine-grained PATs instead of classic PATs.
